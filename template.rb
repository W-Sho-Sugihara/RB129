# New Section OOP

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

=begin
OOP is a programming paradigm that uses classes and objects to organize both data as attributes and procedures as methods. Classes are used as a blueprint to determine the attributes and methods of an object. An object is an instance of its class and it is upon instantiation that the values of its predefined attributes are given values.

OOP uses inheritance to allow parent classes to share methods with child classes, encapsulation to restrict access to certain data and methods, polymorphism to allow different data types to respond to a common interface differently.

Inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism allows OOP to create and structure code that is more flexible, resuable and maintainable.

OOP is what allows larger programs to be flexible, maintainable, resuable and scalable.
=end

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

# AA New Section Classes and Objects

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

# AA1sub-section Objects
=begin
Objects contain data about their current state and behavior. Classes provide the templates from which objects are created. An object is an instance of a class. Each object instance of a class is unique even if the objects share the same class.

Example:

1.class => Integer
2.class => Integer
"Hi".class => String
"Hello".class => String

=end

# AA2sub-section Classes
=begin
Classes are the templates from which objects are created. The attributes and behaviors of objects in Ruby are defined in its class.  
Example:

class Person
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name #attribute/state
  end

  def method #behavior
    some code
  end

=end



# AA3sub-section Object Instantiation
=begin
When an object is created from a class it is called instantiation, in other words, an object is an instance of a class.

Example:

class Person; end

joe = Person.new

=end

# AA4sub-section Instance Variables
=begin
Instance variable are variables within an instantiated object begining with an `@` mark. Instance variables contain the state of an object instance and are scoped to the object instance. The values of the instance variables are what make each object unique.
=end

#AA5sub-section Instance Methods
=begin
Instance methods are the methods accessible to instances of a class. They cannot be invoked by the class itself and must be invoked by an object instance.
=end

#AA6sub-section Class Variables
=begin
Class variables are variables within a class begining with `@@`. Class variables are shared by all instances of that class unlike instance variables that are unique for each instance. Class variables are also inherited. Class variables are accessible by both class and instance methods.
=end

#AA7sub-section Class Methods
=begin
Class methods are methods that are invokable only by the class itself and not by an instance of that class. Class methods begin with `self` te distinguish between class and instance methods.

Example:

class SomeClass
  @@class_variable # because it begind with '@@'

  def method #instance mehod
    @some_var = "Instance Variable"
  end

  def self.some_method #class method because it begins with `self`
    #code
  end
end

=end

#AA8sub-section Class Constants
=begin
Constants are defines using uppercase letters and are lexically scoped. 

(Jump to JJ Lexical Scoping)

Example

class Person
  SPECIES = "homo sapien"
end

=end

#AA9sub-section Instance Methods vs Class Methods
=begin
Instance methods: methods inside the class that an object can call once instantiated.

Class methods: methods that are called on the class directly and not from instatiated objects.

Example:

class Person

  def self.some_class_method
    "Class Method!!"
  end

  def some_instance_method
    "Instance Method!!!"
  end
end
Person.some_class_method #=> "Class Method!!"
Person.new.some_instance_method #=> "Instance Method!!!"

=end

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

# BB New Section Setter and Getter Methods

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

=begin
It is generally better to use setter and getter methods when trying to set and retrieve an instance variable rather than reference the instance variable directly. One reason being that setter and getter methods allow us to create general functionality in method definitions that we can use whenever we want to either retrieve or set an instance variable. This could be hiding the raw data (like for SSN's) or formatting the data (like phone #'s to (***) *** - **** ). Getters and setters also allow for more maintainability when those desired functionalities of retrieving and setting instance variables may change in the future. Setter and getter methods play an important role in keeping our code DRY, readable and maintainable.
=end

# BB1sub-section Getter Methods

=begin
Getter methods are instance methods that allow us to view the value of an object assigned to an instance variable.

Example:

class Person
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def name # getter method
    @name
  end
end
=end

#BB2sub-section Setter Methods

=begin
Setter methods are instance methods that allow us to reassign an instance variable to a new object.

Example:

class Person
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def name=(new_name) # setter method
    @name = new_name
  end
end
=end

#BB3sub-section Using attr\_\*

=begin
`attr_accessor` is a method that takes symbols as an argument and uses them to creates getter and setter methods. `attr_*` methods simplifies creating getter and setter methods for instance variables by replacing multiple lines of code that would have been needed to create getter and/or setter methds for each instance variable.

    attr_accessor :name, :age, :dob

`attr_reader` is a method that takes symbols as an argument and creates getter methods with the same name as the symbol. `attr_*` methods simplifies creating getter and setter methods for instance variables by replacing multiple lines of code that would have been needed to create getter and/or setter methds for each instance variable.

    attr_reader :name, :age, :dob

`attr_writer` is a method that takes symbols as an argument and creates setter methods with the same name as the symbol. `attr_*` methods simplifies creating getter and setter methods for instance variables by replacing multiple lines of code that would have been needed to create getter and/or setter methds for each instance variable.

    attr_writer :name, :age, :dob

Example:

class Student
  attr_accessor :name
  attr_reader :student_id

  def initialize(name, student_id)
    @name = name
    @student_id = student_id
  end
end

=end

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

#CC New Section Method Access Control

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

=begin
Method access control in ruby is implemented by controlling the access to the methods within its classes using the `public`, `private` & `protected` access methods. By controlling the access to its methods, we are able to control which interfaces are private and which are public.
=end

#CC1sub-section Public
=begin
All instance methods other than `initialize` are public by default and are accessible to to all public interfaces.
=end

#CC2sub-section Private
=begin
The `pivate` method makes the methods following it private and only accessible with other methods within the current class instance. Interfaces of other instances (including the same class type) cannot access private methods. Instance variables are also private by default and are only veiwable and settable by use of methods.
=end

#CC3sub-section Protected
=begin
The `protected` method makes the methods following it protected and only accessible with other methods within the current class instance and by other instances of the same class. From within the class `protected` methods act like public methods and from outside the class they act like `private` methds. Hence when other instance objects call protected methods from within the class they do not raise an error.
=end

=begin
Example:

class Person

  def initialize(name, dob, age) #private method
    @name = name
    @dob = dob
    @age = age
  end

  def name #public method
    @name
  end

  def compare_age(other_p) #public method
    #calls a protected method of a different object
    if age > other_p.age
      puts "#{name} is older the #{other_p.name}."
    else
      puts "#{other_p.name} is older the #{name}."
    end
  end

  def print_b_day # calls a private method from within the instance
    dob = self.dob[0..1].join('/')
    puts dob
  end

  protected

  def age #protected method
    @age
  end

  private

  def dob #private method
    @dob.split("/") #=>[mm,dd,yyyy]
  end
end

class Pet
  def compare_age(other_p)
    #calls a protected method of a different object
    if 10 > other_p.age
      puts "#{name} is older the #{other_p.name}."
    else
      puts "#{other_p.name} is older the #{name}."
    end
  end
end

joe = Person.new("joe", '11/22/1999', 40)
joe.name # => "joe", because `name` is a public method and can be called outside the class
mack = Person.new("mack", '11/22/1999', 30)
joe.compare_age(mack) # => will not raise an error because same classes

momo = Pet.new
momo.compare_age(joe) # => will raise an error, because they are different classes

=end

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

#DD New Section Inheritance

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

#DD1sub-section Class Inheritance
=begin
Attributes and behaviours are inherited from superclasses by subclasses classes through class inheritance. Through inheritance a subclass has access to the behaviors of their superclasses. A class can only have one superclass, but can be inherited by multiple classes.

Example:

class Parent
  def move
    "MOVE"
  end
end

class Child < Parent; end

Child.new.move #=> "MOVE"

=end

#DD2sub-section Interface Inheritance
=begin
Interface inheritance is when a class inherits the interfaces of a module mixin. Once interface inheritance takes place in a superclass, subclasses will inherit those behaviors through class inheritance.

Example:

module Methods
  def some_method
    "I'm a mixed in method!!"
  end
end

class Person
  include Methods
end

Person.new.some_method #=> "I'm a mixed in method!!"

=end

#DD3sub-section Method Lookup Path
=begin
Method lookup path is the hierarchical order ruby will inspect in a class to find a method. It begins in the class of the object instance, then looks at the mixins of the current class beginning with the last mixed in module up to the first (bottom to top order), them moves on the the superclass, if not found then looks at the mixins of the superclass beginning with the last mixed in module up to the first (bottom to top order), and so on up superclasses until the called method is found and executed or is never found and raises an error.
=end

#DD4sub-section Super
=begin
The `Super` keyword is used when a method in a subclass has overridden a method of a superclass but still desires to use the functionality of the overridden method in the superclass. When the `super` keyword is added to a method definition and the method is invoked, `super` will search the method lookup path for a method of the same name as the current method and invoke it.

Example:
class Person
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

class Child < Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    super(name)
    @age = age
  end
end

p Child.new('joe', 23) #=> <Child:0x00005633e6452340 @name="joe", @age=23>

=end

#DD5sub-section Object Methods
=begin

=end

#DD6sub-section Variable Scope with Inheritance
=begin
Instance variables are scoped to their object instances and can be referenced anywhere in the class definition. All instance variables in the superclasses are also scoped to the instantiated object. The scope of class variables are shared among all instances of the class and all instances of its subclasses.

Example:
class Parent

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @@grandpa_quote = "greatest grandpa"
  end
end

class Child < Parent; end

class Grandchild < Child

  def name
    @name
  end

  def grandpa_quote
    @@grandpa_quote
  end

  def grandpa_quote=(v)
    @@grandpa_quote = v
  end
end

matt = Grandchild.new('matt')
bill = Grandchild.new('bill')

p matt.grandpa_quote # => "greatest grandpa"
p bill.grandpa_quote # => "greatest grandpa"

matt.grandpa_quote = "better than grandma"

p matt.grandpa_quote # => "better than grandma"
p bill.grandpa_quote # => "better than grandma" because the class variable `@@grandpa_quote` is shared by both `matt` and `bill`.
=end

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

#EE New Section Polymorphism & Encapsulation

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

#EE1sub-section Polymorphism
=begin
Polymorphism is when different data types respond to a common interface differently. For example, two different objects types have a method of the same name and when that method is called the method will not care which of the two objects is calling it. This is polymorphism.

Example:

array = ["string", [1,2,3], { My: "Hash" }]

array.each do |obj|
  p obj.empty?
end

In the above example the array contains three different object types, a string, an array, and a hash. Iterating through this array we call the `empty?` method on each object in the array without raising an error. We can see through this example that the `empty?` method is polymorphic because it was called on different data types and still worked.

=end

#EE2sub-section Polymorphism Through Inheritance
=begin
Polymorphism occurs through inheritance when a method in a superclass is overridden in a subclass method. Each subclass of a supclass could each have its own version of a method in a superclass.
Example:

class Parent
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
  def favorite_food
    puts "#{self}'s favorite food is sushi!"
  end

  def to_s
    @name
  end
end

class Oldest_son < Parent
  def favorite_food
    puts "#{@name}'s favorite food is pizza!"
  end
end

class Oldest_daughter < Parent
  def favorite_food
    puts "#{@name}'s favorite food is icecream!"
  end
end

class Second_son < Parent
  def favorite_food
    puts "#{@name}'s favorite food is mac 'n' cheese!"
  end
end

class Second_daughter< Parent
  def favorite_food
   puts "#{@name}'s favorite food is pizza!"
  end
end

joe = Oldest_son.new('joe')
mack = Second_son.new('mack')
eli = Oldest_daughter.new('Eli')
liz = Second_daughter.new('Liz')

arr = [joe, mack, eli, liz]

arr.each { |child| child.favorite_food }

This example demonstrated polymorphism through overriding methods, because each subclass of the superclass `Parent` contain a method `favorite_food` but each have unique functionality. Hence we can call `favorite_food` on all the subclasses of `Parent` and all will output a different result.

=end

#EE3sub-section Polymorphism Through Duck Typing
=begin
Polymorphism through duck typing is when unrelated objects have methods of the same name. Because duck typing is unconcerned with the object type all that is important is that the object has the method with the same name.
For Example:

class FishingPole
  def string
    'Fishing line'
  end
end

class Knitting
  def string
    "Yarn"
  end
end

class YoYo
  def string
    "Stuck!!!"
  end
end

[FishingPole.new, Knitting.new, YoYo.new].each do |each|
  p each.string
end

The above example demonstrates polymorphism through duck typing because a common interface, the `string` method, interacts with different data types, classes `FishingPole`, `Knitting`, and `YoYo`, differently. 

==================
Example:

array = ["string", [1,2,3], { My: "Hash" }]

array.each do |obj|
  p obj.empty?
end

The objects in `array` are all different types and are unrelated. However, the `empty?` method doesn't care that the objects are different as long as they all have an instance method `empty?`. We can thus say that the method `empty?` is polymorphic and this example is an example of polymorphism through duck typing.
=end

#EE4sub-section Encapsulation
=begin
Encapsulation allow us to determine what information within an object is accessible outside the object, in other words, what within an object is pulic and what is private. Ruby uses method access controls to inplement encapsulation. Encapsulation is important because it allow us prevent unwanted or unexpected changes to our code through interacting with other public interfaces. 

Example:

class Person
  def initialize(name, ssn) #private method
    @name = name
    @ssn = ssn
  end

  def name # public method be default 
    @name
  end

  private # method access method

  def ssn #private getter method
    @ssn
  end
end

=end

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

#FF New Section Modules

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

=begin
Modules are a collection of methods, constants and classes. Modules cannot be instantiated, but are mixed into classes when the methods, constants or classes within the module are needed inside a certain class. Modules can be inherited by subclasses if they are mixed into the superclass. Modules allows for flexible resuability as modules can be mixed into any class and a class can have multiple modules.  
=end

#FF1sub-section Mixin Modules
=begin
Mixing modules into classes allow us to add behaviors to multiple classes that do not have a logical parent class which to add the desired behaviors. Mixed in behaviors will be inherited by subclasses of the class where the modules are mied into. Mixins allow more flexibility and reusability while keeping our code DRY. A class can have multiple mixins.

Example:
module Drivable
  def drive
    "Driving"
  end
end

class F1_Racer
  include Drivable
end

class Parent
  include Drivable
end

class Teenager < Parent
end

Teenager.new.drive #=> "Driving"
F1_Racer.new.drive #=> "Driving"

=end

#FF2sub-section Namespacing
=begin
Namespacing referse to using modules to store similar classes and methods. This allows to better organize code by grouping similar classes and/or methods together and to prevent possible collision of similarly names classes and/or methods.

Example:

module Pets
  class Dog; end

  class Cat; end

  class Goldfish; end

  class Hamster; end

  def some_method
    "I'm a method!!"
  end
end

Pets::Dog.new
Pets::Cat.new
Pets::Goldfish.new

=end

#FF3sub-section Module Methods
=begin
Modules can have their own methods just like class methods. Module methods are used when a random or seemingly unrelated behavior is required in the code. If there is no logical place within classes or mixins for a particular code that might indicate it should be a module method.
Example:

module Other
  def self.number_0_to_100
    rand(100)
  end
end

Other.number_0_to_100

=end

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

#GG New Section Self

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

#GG1sub-section Inside Instance Methods
=begin
`Self` inside instance methods refers to the object instance calling the method.
Example:

class Person
  def instance_method
    self # refers to the calling object instance
  end
end

Person.new.instance_method #=> this new object instance

=end

#GG2sub-section Inside Class Methods
=begin
`Self` inside class methods refers to the class object calling the method.
Example:

class Person
  def self.class_method # the `self` makes this a class method
    self # refers to the calling class object
  end
end

Person.class_method #=> returns the class name `Person`

=end

#GG3sub-section Inside Class Definitions
=begin
`Self` inside class definitions refer to the class object.
Example:
class Person
  self #=> refers to the class object
end

=end

#GG4sub-section Inside Mixin Modules
=begin
`Self` in instance methods from mixins will refer to the object instance calling the method. If `self` is within a module method then `self` will reference the module object.
Example:

module Person
  self #=> refers to the module object itself

  def some_method
    self #=> refers to the object instance calling this method
  end
end

=end

#GG5sub-section Outside Any Class
=begin
`Self` outside any class will reference the `main` instance object of Ruby's `Object` class.
=end

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

#HH New Section Fake Operators and Equality

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

#HHa New Section Equivalence

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

#HHa1sub-section ==
=begin
The BasicObject method `==` compares two objects to see if they are the same object. This method has been overridden in many subclasses and have different functionality depending on the calling class. For example, String `==` method will compare the value of the objects instead of the objects themselves ("string" == "string" => true).
Example:

a = "string"
b = "string"
a == b #=> true
a.object_id == b.object_id #=> false

class Person; end

Person == Person #=> true, they are the same class object

=end

#HHa2sub-section equal? and object_id
=begin
The `equal?` method will test to see if two object point to the same space in memory, or in other words see if they are the same object.
Example:

a = "string"
b = "string"
a.equal? b #=> false because they are two different String objects

class Person; end

Person.equal? Person #=> true, they are the same class object

=end

#HHa3sub-section ===
=begin
The `===` method will compare the caller and the passed in argument and see if the argument is part of the calling group. 
Examples:

String === 'Hi" will return `true` because `'Hi'` is part of the String class group, so to speak. 

(0..10) === 4 would also return `true` because 4 is a part of the range 0 through 10.

=end

#HHa4sub-section eql?
=begin
The `eql?` method if used by `Hash` it will compare two objects to see if they refer to the same hash key. When used by other Object subclasses it is very similar to `==`, though there are some exceptions. 
Example:

'HI'.eql? 'HI' #=> true
'HI' == 'HI' #=> true

1 == 1.0 #=> true
1.eql? 1.0 #=> false


=end

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

#HHb1 New Section Comparison Methods

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

#HHb1sub-section Comparison Methods
=begin
When comparing objects we create an instance method with the `<=>` to specify what we want to compare and mixin the `Comparable` module.

Example:

class Person
  include Comparable

  attr_reader :age

  def initialize(age)
    @age = age
  end

  def <=>(other)
    age <=> other.age
  end
end

joe = Person.new(30)
mack = Person.new(31)

joe > mack #=> false

=end

#HHb2sub-section Plus
=begin
The `+` method is not a predefined method in the Ruby `Object` class. Therefore if we wanted to impliment a `+` method we have to define a new instance method.
Example:

class Person
  attr_reader :age

  def initialize(age)
    @age = age
  end

  def +(other)
    age + other.age
  end
end

joe = Person.new(30)
mack = Person.new(31)

joe + mack #=> 61

=end

#HHb3sub-section Element Setters and Getters
=begin
`[]=`, and `[]` are both array methods `Array#[]=()` and `Array#[]()` respectively. These can be added to classes to create unique functionality in conjunction with arrays.

For Example:

class List
  attr_accessor :list

  def initialize
    @list = []
  end

  def [](i)
    list[i].name
  end

  def []=(i, task)
    list[i] = Task.new(task)
  end
end

class Task
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

moms_list = List.new
moms_list[0] = 'grocery shopping'

=end

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

# II New Section Collaborator Objects

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

=begin
Collaborator objects are objects in different classes that share an associative relationship. Collaborator objects can be any object type and are a part of a different objects state. Collaborator objects are important in OOP because they represent the corrolation between objects within a program.

For Example:

class Person
  def initialize(name, friend = nil)
    @name = name
    @friend = friend
  end
end

joe = Person.new('joe') #=> The string object 'joe' assigned to instance variable `@name` is now a collaborator object for the new `Person` object `joe`

mack = Person.new('mack', joe) #=> The `joe` object is now a collaborator object of object instance `mack` because `joe` is now part of `mack`'s state by being assigned to `mack`'s instance variable `@friend`.

=end

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

# JJ New Section Lexical Scope

# ****************************************\*\*****************************************

=begin
Lexical scope is the scope of where the code is located, wether that be in a method definition, a block or in the main scope.

When constants are referenced within a class ruby will look for the constant in the current lexical scope of where it is being refereneced and if not found in the current scope move up the hierarchy. When searching up the hierarchy inheritance is taken into account and will move up the parent classes. However, constants referenced in mixed in modules will not be able to find those constants defined in class objects unless specifically stated where the constant is defined.

Example: 

module Display
  def show_species
    "I'm a #{SPECIES}."
  end

class Person
  SPECIES = "homo sapien"

  include Display
end

Person.new.show_species #=> Will reaise an error because ruby looks for the constant `SPECIES` in the the lexical scope which in this case is the module `Display`. However, ruby cannot find the constant `SPECIES` in the module `Display` and because that is where the hierarchy ends ruby will raise an error.

In order for ruby to find the constant we must specifically state in what lexical scope the constant can be found.

module Display
  def show_species
    "I'm a #{Person::SPECIES}" # this tells ruby that the constant `SPECIES` can be found in the lexical scope of the `Person` class.
  end
end

=end
